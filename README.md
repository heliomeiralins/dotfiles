# dotfiles

## Motivation and Rationale

I decided to throw away my precious dotfiles and start from scratch using Ansible. I hope to learn more about
Ansible and have my setup easier to deploy on new machines than my previous dotfiles based on `stow`.

To better understand the tools I use, I shall not add configuration that I don't understand and I will comment
whenever possible what things do.

I am running two recently installed systems with Arch and I already have several `roles` that install most of my
dependencies. I will refactor those here in due time.

My plan is to start with basic configuration of these tools:
* fish
* alacritty
* i3
* vim/neovim

After that I will refactor my dependencies in here and start tweaking. I plan to share how to use new tools I
incorporate in my workflow and useful tweaks and tips as this grows.
